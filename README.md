# JQuery-First-steps
Enough JS for a while. I'm learning JQuery now

Game - The first time ever that I used jQuery. In this game I did a lot of exploration, trying new machanics and ofc a new language.
CRUD - A lot of Ajax and DOM manipulation training. Contains a table, with all its data stored in the $_SESSION. It has a log in, an "Add new row" button, Remove row and a lovely Edit.
